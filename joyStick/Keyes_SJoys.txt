HOWTO: Wire the Keyes “SJoys” Joystick

Continuing on in this series, here’s how to wire up this Joystick. The pins are, left to right:

Ground - wired to the ground rail
+5V - wired to the power rail
VRx - the “X” value of the joystick, wired to Analog In 0
VRy - the “Y” value of the joystick, wired to Analog In 1
SW - the switch (you can press down), wired to Digital In 8
All in all this is really quite straight forward. X and Y are as per Arduino usual returning values between 0 and 1024.

Here’s a little sketch to see what’s going on - just open up the Serial Monitor at 9600 baud.

// analog
int pin_x = 0;
int pin_y = 1;

// digital
int pin_switch = 8;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  
  pinMode(pin_switch, INPUT);
}

 void loop() {
  int x = analogRead(pin_x);   
  int y = analogRead(pin_y);   
  int b = digitalRead(pin_switch);   
  
  Serial.print("X:");
  Serial.print(x);
  Serial.print(",");
  Serial.print("Y:");
  Serial.print(y);
  Serial.print(",");
  Serial.print("B:");
  Serial.print(b);
  Serial.print("\n");
 }
